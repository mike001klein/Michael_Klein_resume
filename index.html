				<h2>Bio</h2>
				<p>
					I am a mechanical engineering graduate with lots of ambition. I am also a software engineer looking to kickstart my career and work hard to make a name for myself. I have a strong passion for learning, developing skills and aquiring new insights in the <abbr title="Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics">STEM</abbr> fileds.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					I have always had a passion for anything mechanical and especially cars. I love knowing how things work and have always had an interest in taking things apart to see their inner workings, which is why I decided to study mechanical engineering at Wits University. My final year Research project was on "<abbr title="Brain Computer Interface">BCI</abbr> for External Device Control" which involved a lot of machine learning and software development. This sparked my intersest in coding and since graduating from engineering, I have completed a software engineering course through <a href="https://www.hyperiondev.com/" target=_blank>HyperionDev</a>.
				</p>

				<p>
					In the future I would like to use a combination of my engineering and coding skills to creata a career for myself where I am able to make a difference in the world around me. I would like to work for a company that values me and work my way up the company ranks to a senior position through hard work and dedication, making a good living doing something that I enjoy.

				<h2>Projects Completed during software engineering bootcamp:</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Finance Calculator</li>
						<p>
							A program that serves as both an investment calculator and a home loan repayment calculator. The user inputs the calculation they wish to compute and the relevant inputs required for the calculation. The program then outputs the amount accumulated after the investment period using either simple or compound interest, or the amount that has to be repayed on a home loan using nested if statement.
